Structural analysis of minuscule height objects holds paramount significance in fields such as industrial manufacturing and medical testing. Currently, 3D reconstruction method based on shape from focus (SFF) has emerged as an efficacious approach for acquiring submicron-level height change information. A novel multi-field SFF(MF-SFF) framework incorporates pulse-controlled continuous acquisition methods and parallel chain processing (PCP) strategy, effectively addressing challenges associated with minuscule height objects. The MF-SFF framework not only accomplishes high-precision and rapid 3D reconstruction but also demonstrates robust adaptability. It overcomes issues related to the rapid collection and processing of massive image data during the 3D reconstruction of objects. This is a image dataset for 3D reconstruction based on MF-SFF.

Please conduct SFF based 3D reconstruction testing based on the parameters provided in "Param". In each numbered folder, such as "001003", where "001" represents the X-direction field of view number and "003" represents the Y-direction field of view number.
